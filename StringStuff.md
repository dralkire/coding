## Stuff you can do with strings (part 1)



1. Find the length with `len(str)`
```python
length = len("yes!")
print(length)
```
```
4
```

2. Make a big multi-line string using triple single-quotes `''' '''`
```python
print('''H
  E
    L
      L
        O''')
```
```
H
  E
    L
      L
        O
```

3. Create vertical space with `"\n"`
```python
print("H\n\n\nELLO")
```
```
H


ELLO
```

4. Hold place to put a string later with `"{}"`
```python
joke = 'A {} is a device for finding furniture in the dark.'
```
And put a string in place by using the *method* `str.format(str)`.
